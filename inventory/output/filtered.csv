Unlike many other tools based on systems of equations, ReSiE uses rule-based algorithms, system dynamics and an agent-based approach. This approach enables detailed simulations without linearization, capturing energy flow and system state in each time step. The central mathematical model is based on energy balances and the order of the energy calculations that is determined during preprocessing. In addition, ReSiE is suitable to perform black-box optimizations for optimal component sizing. The model can be easily extended by any energy carriers and additional components or storages of variable complexity.
