Energy Policy Simulator,"About the Energy Policy Simulator
The Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is a computer model developed by Energy Innovation LLC as part of its Energy Policy Solutions project, an effort which aims to inform policymakers and regulators about which climate and energy policies will reduce greenhouse gas emissions most effectively and at the lowest cost.
The EPS allows the user to control dozens of different policies that affect energy use and emissions in various sectors of the economy (such as a carbon tax, fuel economy standards for vehicles, reducing methane leakage from industry, and accelerated R&D advancement of various technologies). The model includes every major sector of the economy: transportation, electricity supply, buildings, industry, agriculture, and land use. The model reports outputs at annual intervals and provides numerous outputs, including:
->Emissions of 12 different pollutants (CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and eight others), as well as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e; a measure of the global warming potential of various pollutants).
->Direct cash flow (cost or savings) impacts on consumers, industry (as a whole), government, and several specific industries
->Human deaths avoided thanks to reduced particulate pollution
The composition and output of the electricity sector (e.g. capacity and generation from coal, natural gas, wind, solar, etc.)
->Vehicle technology market shares and fleet composition (electric vehicles, etc.)
->Energy use by fuel type from various energy-using technologies (specific types of vehicles, building components, etc.)
->Breakdowns of how each policy within a policy package contributes to total abatement and the cost-effectiveness of each policy (e.g. wedge diagrams and cost curves)
The EPS is a system dynamics computer model created in a commercial program called Vensim. Vensim is a tool produced by Ventana Systems for the creation and simulation of system dynamics models. The Energy Policy Simulator has been designed to be used with the free Vensim Model Reader. Directions on how to obtain Vensim Model Reader and the Energy Policy Simulator can be found on the Download and Installation Instructions page.
The model is distributed with a complete set of input data representing the United States, but it has a modular structure that allows it to be adapted to different countries and regions by swapping the input data. The EPS reads in all of its input data from external text files, which are generated by accompanying Excel files. All of these files are included in the model distribution.

MultiMod,"The energy system and resource market model ""MultiMod"" is a large-scale representation of the supply and demand of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. It captures endogenous substitution between fuels, infrastructure constraints and endogenous investment (e.g., pipeline capacity, power generation technologies), as well as market power by producers of fossil fuels in a unified framework. 
The mathematical framework of the MultiMod model is a dynamic Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) derived from individual players' profit maximisation problems. The formulation is generic and flexible, so that the supply chain of any number of fossil and renewable fuels can be modelled. The framework includes seasonality and allows for a detailed infrastructure representation and a comprehensive transformation sector. Investment in infrastructure (transportation, seasonal storage, transformation) is determined endogenously in the model according to the respective player’s inter-temporal optimisation problem. Furthermore, substitution between different energy carriers on the final demand side is endogenous. Modelling co-production of fuels (e.g. crude oil and associated gas) is possible, as well as a flexible setup of transformation units (multiple inputs, multiple outputs). By formulating the model as an equilibrium problem derived from non-cooperative game theory, the model can incorporate Cournot market power by individual suppliers as well as distinct discount rates by various players concerning their investment.
The current framework is an open-loop perfect foresight model. A stochastic version of the model is under development at NTNU Trondheim. This will allow for consideration of uncertainty and distinct risk profiles for individual players along the supply chain, including investment by consumers in energy efficiency.
For the model description paper, a database representing the global energy system was compiled and used for scenario analysis (Huppmann & Egging, 2014). New datasets or variations on the initial data base are currently under development within specific research projects:
- Focus on US domestic conventional crude and shale oil infrastructure (lead: Johns Hopkins University)
- Focus on Chinese coal policies (lead: Tsinghua University)

QuaSi - GenSim,"GenSim - for ""generic building simulation"" - is a building simulation software using the EnergyPlus® simulation engine to generate high-resolution heating and cooling demand profiles as well as electricity demand profiles for buildings with various types of use. ""Generic"" in this context refers to a ""generally valid"" building model. This means that the software is versatile enough to simulate any type of building in a very flexible and simplified way, enabling users to efficiently adapt the software for any building design.
GenSim was specifically devloped for the use during project pre-planning where detailed simulations of buildings are challenging due to typically constrained time budgets and limited availability of information. Traditional simulation tools require extensive input data, making the process time-consuming. GenSim addresses this by providing presets for multiple building typologies and a streamlined approach for quick, simple, yet accurate building simulations. This is particularly valuable in early planning stages when only rough data about the planned buildings is available. If more detailed information (wall structure, detailed geometry, specific use, ...) is available about the building to be examined, this can be used for more precise results.

SIREN,"SIREN uses external datasets to model the potential for renewable energy generation for a geographic region. The approach is to model the data on an hourly basis for a desired year (ignoring leap days, that is, 8,760 hours). Users explore potential location and scale of renewable energy sources (stations, storage, transmission) to meet electricity demand. It is possible to model any geographic area and uses a number of open or publicly available data sources:

Maps can be created from OpenStreet Map (MapQuest) tiles
Weather data files can be created from NASA (MERRA2) or ECMWF (ERA5) satellite data
It uses US NREL SAM models to calculate energy generation

SIREN is available, packaged for Windows, on Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sensiren/). There's a help file (https://rawgit.com/ozsolarwind/siren/master/help.html) which describes ""how it works"".

SimSEE,"SimSEE is a platform for the Simulation of Systems of Electrical Energy. As such, it allows creating simulators tailored to a generation system, simply by adding the different types of Actors (thermal, wind, solar and hydraulic generators, demand, interconnections, etc.) to a Play-Room (simulation environment). These Actors behave in the Room according to their type.
It is 100% programmed with Object Oriented technology which makes it easy to incorporate new models (types of Actors).
To simulate the optimal operation of an Electric Power System, SimSEE solves a Dynamic Stochastic Programming problem, obtaining as a result an Optimal Operation Policy. Using this Policy, different realizations of the stochastic processes (chronicles or possible histories of the future of the system) are simulated.
Since 2010, SimSEE has become the tool commonly used in Uruguay to simulate the operation of the energy system, mainly due to the good stochastic models developed for the modeling of wind and solar energy.

TIMES_PT characterizes the entire chain of the Portuguese energy system from 2005 to 2050 (in 5-year steps), including energy imports and production (e.g., oil and bio refineries), transformation (e.g., power and heat production), distribution, exports and end-use consumption, in industry, residential, services, agriculture and transport sectors and their respective sub-sectors.
TIMES_PT has been developed since 2004 and has benefited from the peer-review of numerous national partners from industrial sectors, power production, oil refining and end-use energy sectors. TIMES_PT model informed climate policy in Portugal in the last 10 years and has supported the design of climate mitigation policies.

The development of the TIMES_PT model started within the EU research project NEEDS and the national research project E2POL. Although its implementation was motivated by research goals, during the past decade the model has become a major tool supporting national climate mitigation policies, and to a lesser extent, air pollution policies. The Low Carbon Roadmap 2050 is a flagship policy document currently used as the Portuguese long term view on mitigation goals, while the PNAC— National Plan on Climate Change includes the visions up to 2030 from stakeholders from other policy areas, as transportation and industry. The negotiations for the revisions of the National Emission Ceilings Directive for 2020 and 2030, as well as the National Strategy for Air Quality (2015) were supported by projections generated by TIMES_PT. More recently, TIMES_PT was linked with a national CGE model, which has motivated its use in the Green Tax Reform.motivated its use in the Green Tax Reform.",https://iea-etsap.org/index.php/documentation,openmod,,times_pt
